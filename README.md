# El Futuro de las ECOAs - Web Application Proposal

This project is a proposal for a web application aimed at improving the student evaluation process for teachers at Tecnol√≥gico de Monterrey. The application utilizes modern web development technologies and integrates the ChatGPT API to create personalized surveys and feedback reports.

**Technologies Used**:
- **Front-end**: React, Tailwind CSS, Vite
- **Back-end**: Node.js, Express
- **Database**: PostgreSQL, pgAdmin
- **API Integration**: ChatGPT API for personalized survey generation
- **Development Tools**: Postman, pgAdmin, Git

## Key Features

- **Personalized Surveys**: Each student receives unique survey questions generated in real-time using the ChatGPT API.
- **Real-time Feedback**: Professors can view personalized feedback summaries generated from student responses.
- **User Roles**: Separate dashboards for students and professors, with different functionalities for each user type.
  - **Students**: Can view their courses and complete "ECOA" surveys.
  - **Professors**: Can view courses they teach, see which students completed the survey, and generate overall performance reports.
- **Database Integration**: PostgreSQL used for storing user data, survey responses, and report generation.

## Project Structure

- **Front-end**: Built using React, with Tailwind CSS for styling and Vite for fast builds and development.
- **Back-end**: Node.js handles the server-side operations, including API routes and database interactions.
- **Database**: PostgreSQL stores user information, survey responses, and reports. Queries are handled using pgAdmin and Postman for testing.
- **ChatGPT API**: Used to dynamically generate questions and create comprehensive feedback for professors based on student responses.

## How It Works

1. **Student Dashboard**: After logging in, students can view their enrolled courses and start a new ECOA survey.
2. **Survey Interaction**: Each question in the survey is dynamically generated by the ChatGPT API, and student responses are recorded.
3. **Professor Dashboard**: Professors can view their courses, see which students have completed the surveys, and generate performance reports from the responses.
4. **Feedback Generation**: A summary of all student responses is compiled using the ChatGPT API, which generates a detailed feedback report for professors.
